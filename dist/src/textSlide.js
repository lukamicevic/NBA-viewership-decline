	'intro': 'The NBA Finals was once the undisputed king of summer television. Over the last decade, \
	it has seen its average US viewership drop by more than 30%. By contrast, the NFL’s Super Bowl has \
	increased 10% over that same period. Major League Baseball’s World Series has increased 30%. And the \
	Champions League Final has steadily increased by 7%. The following chart lays these four championship \
	series side by side, highlighting basketball’s decline.',

	'popularity': 'While national TV audiences shrink, the NBA’s popularity has never been higher. Players \
	and teams have more endorsements and followers. Highlights and social media clips get more views. Talk show \
	debates about player rankings and bad calls are more heated. The following chart showcases the popularity of the \
	NBA and its teams from 2004-2024 based on their Google Trends ’Interest Over Time’ score.',

	'state-map-teams': 'With the rise of social media and NBA League Pass, fans can keep better track of teams \
	and players not in their local area. The following chart explores how teams’ fan bases have broadened and have a \
	more national reach. ',
	
	'feedback': 'These increases in popularity underscore a surprising disconnect between passion and TV tune-in. \
	To further explore this paradox, we conducted a qualitative user study with NBA fans spanning many ages, generations, \
	and markets. Through a survey, we asked how they feel about the league and how they follow games. \
	Their feedback sheds light on shifting viewing habits, the rise of social-media‐driven fandom, and changes in playstyle.\
	We visualized these responses in the following charts. ',
	
	'three-pointer-1': 'Let’s explore a specific example given for the drop in viewership. Over 75% of participants \
	said that the NBA’s current style of play is worse than it was in the past. Of these responses, the most common \
	sentiment was that players take too many 3-pointers now, making the games feel repetitive and even sterile. The following \
	chart shows how shot diet has changed over the last 20 years. ',
	
	'three-pointer-2': 'This shot chart reveals that teams have transitioned from diverse shot attempt locations to\
	mostly taking 3-pointers or high-percentage 2-pointers close to the basket. Since 3-pointers are worth more points \
	than 2-pointers, teams realized that it’s more efficient to shoot more of them, regardless of whether they miss more. \
	This change in playstyle has alienated many fans, even though it has made teams and players more efficient and able to \
	score more than ever, as visualized by the following chart.',
	
	'points-per-game': 'Players in the 2020s are scoring at a higher level than ever before from these gameplay changes. \
	The only players who scored more at a younger age are some of the greatest players of all time, like Michael Jordan, \
	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, and Shaquille O’Neal. This level of scoring volume and efficiency helps make players \
	more exciting and popular by having their highlights played more often and their historic stats being shared on social \
	media. Even more striking is the lack of decline from the 2010s players. In every decade prior, players see a noticeable \
	drop-off in scoring output after year 10. Because of these gameplay changes, players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, and \
	Kevin Durant continue to score in their late 30s as much as they did in their mid-20s. Yet, the common sentiment is that \
	while players are more skilled than ever and teams play better than ever, the television product is still lacking.',
	
	'tug-of-war': 'Beyond on-court changes, a host of off-court factors have chipped away at NBA viewership. The \
	following chart explores the many reasons that contribute to the NBA’s viewership decline over the last decade:',
	
	'conclusion': 'The NBA finds itself at a crossroads: never before have so many fans followed their teams, \
	yet fewer viewers are tuning in to watch the television broadcasts. This tension reflects a fundamental \
	shift in how people consume sports. Highlights and social platforms have become the new watercooler talks. Local \
	loyalty has eclipsed national appointment viewing. And a 24/7 news cycle has reshaped attention spans. Even as the \
	on-court product evolves with faster pace and higher scoring, fan enthusiasm has migrated from the living room to the \
	smartphone. Understanding this is the first step toward reimagining the NBA’s broadcast strategy, digital offerings, \
	and fan experiences so that the league’s surging popularity can once again translate into shared, live-event viewership.'
